                                            C. 1. Read the following text then answers The Legend of Nyi Rantamsari Nyi Rantamsari was a well-known legendary figure in Demak. She was feared and revered as the ruler of the North Sea. It is said that when Nawangwulan (Jaka Tarub's wife) could come back to heaven, she was sad because all of her sisters rejected her. They said that Nawangwulan was no longer a goddess because she had a marriage with human. The only goddess who still sympathized her was Nawangsari. Nawangwulan was so desperate. She went to the South Sea and immersed herself in the sea. Nawangwulan's name changed into Nyi Roro Kidul. As for Nawangsari, she came to the world and became a beautiful woman named Rantamsari. She lived in Kalisalak. Rantamsari then married with Raden Bahu. Rantamsari had a problem in her marriage. Raden Bahu felt upset because Rantamsari was always visited by Nyi Roro Kidul. Eventually, Raden Bahu and Rantamsari were separated. It made Rantamsari sad. His love to Raden Bahu was so big that he decided not to have a husband. However, she couldn't wipe her sadness away. So, she wandered somewhere until finally met with a hermit. The hermit suggested Rantamsari to go to Opak River. Rantamsari was suggested to immerse herself to the river. When she immersed herself, she was picked up by Nyi Roro Kidul. Nyi Roro Kidul then taught Rantamsari how to rule the North Sea. Nyi Roro Kidul also suggested Rantamsari to help people that live along the north coast. Questions: What made Raden Bahu upset? Answer: 2. What is the proof of Rantamsari's love to Raden Bahu? Answer: 3. What was taught by Nyi Roro Kidul to Nyi Rantamsari? Answer:​</a>

Well, let me tell you how to wash a mask cleanly.We need detergent, water, a bucket, hanger, and clip. Now, pour water into the bucket sufficiently. Then,add enough detergent into the bucket. After that, put in our dirty mask and soak for 10 to 15 minutes. Make sureall parts of the mask are immersed in the water.After 10 to 15 minutes, cleanse the mask. Make sure that your hands remain clean. Take the mask andwash it gently. Cleanse the mask using flowing water. Make sure that it is free from detergent. Then, dry it with ahanger and clip under the hot sun. Please remember, iron the mask before using. tolong diterjemahkan ya!!​</a>

                                            There are three different kinds of burns: first degree, second degree, and third degree. Each type of burn requires a different type of medical treatment. The least serious burn is the first degree burn. This burn causes the skin to turn red but does not cause blistering. A mild sunburn is a good example of a first degree burn, and, like a mild sunburn, first degree burns generally do not require medical treatment other than a gentle cooling of the burned skin with ice or cold tap water. Second degree burns, on the other hand, do cause blistering of the skin and should be treated immediately. These burns should be immersed in warm water and then wrapped in a sterile dressing or bandage. (Do not apply butter or grease to these burns. Despite the old wives’ tale, butter does not help burns heal but actually increases the chances of infection.) If a second degree burn covers a large part of the body, then the victim should be taken to the hospital immediately for medical care. Third degree burns are those that char the skin and turn it black or burn so deeply that the skin shows white. These burns usually result from direct contact with flames and have a great chance of becoming infected. All third degree burn victims should receive immediate hospital care. Burns should not be immersed in water, and charred clothing should not be removed from the victim as it may also remove the skin. If possible, a sterile dressing or bandage should be applied to burns before the victim is transported to the hospital. True, False or Not Given 1 The first-degree burns are considered to have the fewest risks. 2 People who get first degree burns have to seek medical help. 3 Warm water is not recommended to immerse second degree burns. 4 The victim of third degree burns should be undressed to avoid infection.</a>

                                            The term ‘Batik’ is an Indonesian-Malay word. Batik has come to be used as a generic term which refers to the process of dyeing fabric by making use of a resist technique- covering areas of cloth with a dye-resistant substance, wax, to prevent them absorbing colours.  The technique is thought to be well over a thousand years old and historical evidence demonstrates that cloth decorated with this resist technique was in use in the early centuries AD in Africa, the Middle East and in several places in Asia.  Although there is no sure explanation as to where batik was first ’invented’, many observers believe that it was brought to Asia by travelers from the Indian subcontinent.
Despite the fact that batik may have originated elsewhere, most observers believe that batik reached its highest artistic expression in Indonesia, particularly in Java.  The art of Batik was later spread to the rest of the Indonesian archipelago and to the Malay Peninsula where the popularity of the cloth led to the establishment of many other production centers.  Batik has become a very central means of artistic expression for many of the areas of Asia and a deeply integrated facet of Asian culture.
Much of the popularity of Batik can be tied to the fact that the batik technique offers immense possibilities for artistic freedom as patterns are applied by actual drawing rather than by weaving with thread.  Another factor in its popularity is the fact that it is so durable.  The colors in Batik are much more resistant to wear than those of painted or printed fabrics because the cloth is completely immersed in dye and the areas not protected by resist are allowed to absorb hues to the extent that the colours will not easily fade.
Modern designers in Indonesia, Malaysia and to a lesser extent Thailand, the Philippines and elsewhere now often use batik design elements and often actual batik clothes in their clothing and accessories.  Although most batik fabric is now decorated and tailored by machine, there still remains a considerable market for high-quality, hand-made batik.

                                            Batik represents one of Indonesian's most venerated traditions and is one of the world's most respected textile arts. Today, batik is seen as a definitively Indonesian's art form and something you don't want to miss should you visit this country. Batik is a method of decorating textiles through dye resistance, in which designs are created by preventing specific parts of a textile from being exposed to dye. So, here's how it works. First, the cloth itself is washed repeatedly to remove any contaminants and then pounded flat to remove wrinkles. Then, the design pattern is traced onto the cloth using a soft material like charcoal. These designs tend to be extraordinarily intricate and complex, so this could take a while. Next, the artist covers the design itself in wax. This is traditionally done using a canting, a small pen-like copper tube that lets the artist draw the molten wax onto the cloth. As any accidental spilling of the wax could ruin the design and therefore the value of the cloth, this must be done with patience and precision. This wax will prevent the design from being dyed the same color as the rest of the fabric, so it's pretty important. Finally, the cloth is immersed in a dye bath. The areas without wax are dyed, while the design covered in wax remains white. From here, this process can be altered and redone as the artist sees fit. By applying wax to different areas; or removing wax from other areas, and dipping the cloth in the same or different dyes, the artist can achieve complex and multi-tonal designs.sebutkan 10 kalimat passive voice!TOLONG BANTUU PLSS​</a>

                                            READ THE TEXT, THEN ANSWER THE QUESTIONS BELOW :   Archimedes’ Principle
        Archimedes who has gone down in history as the guy  ran naked through the street of Syracuse shouting
    “Eureka!” – or “I have it” in Greek  was charged with proving that a new crown made for Hiero II, the
     King of Syracuse was not pure gold. King Hiero II who had commissioned a new royal crown
    provided solid gold to the goldsmith. When the crown arrived, King Hiero II was suspicious that the
5   goldsmith only  used some of the gold, kept the rest for himself and added silver to make the crown the
     correct weight.
         Archimedes was asked to determine whether or not the crown was pure gold without harming it in the
    process. Archimedes who thought long and hard  could not find a method for proving that the crown was
    solid gold. Soon after, he filled a bathtub and noticed that  water spilled over the edge as he got in and
10 realized that the water displaced by his body was equal to the weight of his body.
          Knowing that gold was heavier than other metals, the crown maker could have substituted  the gold.
   His method to determine that the crown was not pure gold. Forgetting that he was undressed, he went  
    running naked down the street from his house to the king palace shouting “Eureka”
       He did several experiments to support his invention. Finally he came to a conclusion  that any object
15 which is immersed in a liquid is buoyed up by a force   that is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by    
     the object. This is known as Archimedes’ principle.
         According to this principle, if a rock  which weighs 100 pounds and has a volume of a cubic  foot
     is submerged in water, splashes out 1 cubic foot of water which weighs 62 pounds. Archimedes
     explained  that the gravitational pull on the rock is 100 pounds downward and the buoyant force is 62
20  pounds upward. Out of water, people would need to exert a force of 100 pounds to lift a  rock. In the
     water people would have to exert a force of 100 pounds minus 62 pounds. It means 38 pounds.
         The buoyant  force of a liquid, or how much it pushes upward, depends on the density of the
     liquid. A body will float if its density is less than that of the liquid in which it is  immersed; it will
     sink if its density is greater. Ice is less dense than water.  Therefore, icebergs float on the surface of
25  the ocean. The density of steel ships which are designed  with many spaces filled with air is less than
     that of water.
       Finally, by implementing this invention, Archimedes solved the King’s problem.  He has found that
     the crown consisted of false gold. By this  conclusion, then the King furiously  punished the goldsmith.

Wooden Frame 7. Sodium carbonate 8. Caustic soda 9. Pan and stove (to heat the wax ) Steps: 1. First, prepare the main materials (the design/pattern and the fabric). 2. Wash the fabric to remove any dirt. 3. Draw the pattern. You can draw it with a pencil directly on the fabric or copy it from a paper pattern. 4. Then apply the hot wax along the pattern outline with a canting. Apply the wax to the line or ornaments that you don't want to colour. This step takes time, so you should be patient. 5. When the wax is fully applied, the fabric can be dyed. Immerse the fabric in sodium carbonate in order to enhance absorption of colour. 6. After that, the fabric is immersed in the actual paint (napthol or indigosol) and then rinsed in cold water. 7. The next step is to remove the wax. To do this, we immerse the batik for a few moments in boiling water. Mix caustic soda with the water to help remove the wax. 8. The last step is to dry the batik fabric and the process of making batik is complete. Answer the following questions: 1. What is the text about? 2. What is the first step to make batik? 3. Why do we need a pencil to make batik? 4. Can we use a colourful fabric to make batik? 5. What should we do after drawing the pattern?BANTU JAWAB KAK-!!!​</a>

She was feared and revered as the ruler of the North Sea. It is said that when Nawangwulan (Jaka Tarub's wife) could come back to heaven, she was sad because all of her sisters rejected her. They said that Nawangwulan was no longer a goddess because she had a marriage with human. The only goddess who still sympathized her was Nawangsari. Nawangwulan was so desperate. She went to the South Sea and immersed herself in the sea. Nawangwulan's name changed into Nyi Roro Kidul. As for Nawangsari, she came to the world and became a beautiful woman named Rantamsari. She lived in Kalisalak. Rantamsari then married with Raden Bahu. Rantamsari had a problem in her marriage. Raden Bahu felt upset because Rantamsari was always visited by Nyi Roro Kidul. Eventually, Raden Bahu and Rantamsari were separated. It made Rantamsari sad. His love to Raden Bahu was so big that he decided not to have a husband. However, she couldn't wipe her sadness away. So, she wandered somewhere until finally met with a hermit. The hermit suggested Rantamsari to go to Opak River. Rantamsari was suggested to immerse herself to the river. When she immersed herself, she was picked up by Nyi Roro Kidul. Nyi Roro Kidul then taught Rantamsari how to rule the North Sea. Nyi Roro Kidul also suggested Rantamsari to help people that live along the north coast. Questions: What made Raden Bahu upset? Answer: 2. What is the proof of Rantamsari's love to Raden Bahu?

                            8. There are three different kinds of burns: first degree, second degree, and third degree. Each type of burn requires a different type of medical treatment. The least serious burn is the first degree burn. This burn causes the skin to turn red but does not cause blistering. A mild sunburn is a good example of a first degree burn, and, like a mild sunburn, first degree burns generally do not require medical treatment other than a gentle cooling of the burned skin with ice or cold tap water. Second degree burns, on the other hand, do cause blistering of the skin and should be treated immediately. These burns should be immersed in warm water and then wrapped in a sterile dressing or bandage. (Do not apply butter or grease to these burns. Despite the old wives’ tale, butter does not help burns heal but actually increases the chances of infection.) If a second degree burn covers a large part of the body, then the victim should be taken to the hospital immediately for medical care. Third degree burns are those that char the skin and turn it black or burn so deeply that the skin shows white. These burns usually result from direct contact with flames and have a great chance of becoming infected. All third degree burn victims should receive immediate hospital care. Burns should not be immersed in water, and charred clothing should not be removed from the victim as it may also remove the skin. If possible, a sterile dressing or bandage should be applied to burns before the victim is transported to the hospital. True, False or Not Given 1 The first-degree burns are considered to have the fewest risks. 2 People who get first degree burns have to seek medical help. 3 Warm water is not recommended to immerse second degree burns. 4 The victim of third degree burns should be undressed to avoid infection.</h2><br />

                            9. The term ‘Batik’ is an Indonesian-Malay word. Batik has come to be used as a generic term which refers to the process of dyeing fabric by making use of a resist technique- covering areas of cloth with a dye-resistant substance, wax, to prevent them absorbing colours.  The technique is thought to be well over a thousand years old and historical evidence demonstrates that cloth decorated with this resist technique was in use in the early centuries AD in Africa, the Middle East and in several places in Asia.  Although there is no sure explanation as to where batik was first ’invented’, many observers believe that it was brought to Asia by travelers from the Indian subcontinent.
Despite the fact that batik may have originated elsewhere, most observers believe that batik reached its highest artistic expression in Indonesia, particularly in Java.  The art of Batik was later spread to the rest of the Indonesian archipelago and to the Malay Peninsula where the popularity of the cloth led to the establishment of many other production centers.  Batik has become a very central means of artistic expression for many of the areas of Asia and a deeply integrated facet of Asian culture.
Much of the popularity of Batik can be tied to the fact that the batik technique offers immense possibilities for artistic freedom as patterns are applied by actual drawing rather than by weaving with thread.  Another factor in its popularity is the fact that it is so durable.  The colors in Batik are much more resistant to wear than those of painted or printed fabrics because the cloth is completely immersed in dye and the areas not protected by resist are allowed to absorb hues to the extent that the colours will not easily fade.
Modern designers in Indonesia, Malaysia and to a lesser extent Thailand, the Philippines and elsewhere now often use batik design elements and often actual batik clothes in their clothing and accessories.  Although most batik fabric is now decorated and tailored by machine, there still remains a considerable market for high-quality, hand-made batik.

                            10. Batik represents one of Indonesian's most venerated traditions and is one of the world's most respected textile arts. Today, batik is seen as a definitively Indonesian's art form and something you don't want to miss should you visit this country. Batik is a method of decorating textiles through dye resistance, in which designs are created by preventing specific parts of a textile from being exposed to dye. So, here's how it works. First, the cloth itself is washed repeatedly to remove any contaminants and then pounded flat to remove wrinkles. Then, the design pattern is traced onto the cloth using a soft material like charcoal. These designs tend to be extraordinarily intricate and complex, so this could take a while. Next, the artist covers the design itself in wax. This is traditionally done using a canting, a small pen-like copper tube that lets the artist draw the molten wax onto the cloth. As any accidental spilling of the wax could ruin the design and therefore the value of the cloth, this must be done with patience and precision. This wax will prevent the design from being dyed the same color as the rest of the fabric, so it's pretty important. Finally, the cloth is immersed in a dye bath. The areas without wax are dyed, while the design covered in wax remains white. From here, this process can be altered and redone as the artist sees fit. By applying wax to different areas; or removing wax from other areas, and dipping the cloth in the same or different dyes, the artist can achieve complex and multi-tonal designs.sebutkan 10 kalimat passive voice!TOLONG BANTUU PLSS​</h2><br />

                            12. READ THE TEXT, THEN ANSWER THE QUESTIONS BELOW :   Archimedes’ Principle
        Archimedes who has gone down in history as the guy  ran naked through the street of Syracuse shouting
    “Eureka!” – or “I have it” in Greek  was charged with proving that a new crown made for Hiero II, the
     King of Syracuse was not pure gold. King Hiero II who had commissioned a new royal crown
    provided solid gold to the goldsmith. When the crown arrived, King Hiero II was suspicious that the
5   goldsmith only  used some of the gold, kept the rest for himself and added silver to make the crown the
     correct weight.
         Archimedes was asked to determine whether or not the crown was pure gold without harming it in the
    process. Archimedes who thought long and hard  could not find a method for proving that the crown was
    solid gold. Soon after, he filled a bathtub and noticed that  water spilled over the edge as he got in and
10 realized that the water displaced by his body was equal to the weight of his body.
          Knowing that gold was heavier than other metals, the crown maker could have substituted  the gold.
   His method to determine that the crown was not pure gold. Forgetting that he was undressed, he went  
    running naked down the street from his house to the king palace shouting “Eureka”
       He did several experiments to support his invention. Finally he came to a conclusion  that any object
15 which is immersed in a liquid is buoyed up by a force   that is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by    
     the object. This is known as Archimedes’ principle.
         According to this principle, if a rock  which weighs 100 pounds and has a volume of a cubic  foot
     is submerged in water, splashes out 1 cubic foot of water which weighs 62 pounds. Archimedes
     explained  that the gravitational pull on the rock is 100 pounds downward and the buoyant force is 62
20  pounds upward. Out of water, people would need to exert a force of 100 pounds to lift a  rock. In the
     water people would have to exert a force of 100 pounds minus 62 pounds. It means 38 pounds.
         The buoyant  force of a liquid, or how much it pushes upward, depends on the density of the
     liquid. A body will float if its density is less than that of the liquid in which it is  immersed; it will
     sink if its density is greater. Ice is less dense than water.  Therefore, icebergs float on the surface of
25  the ocean. The density of steel ships which are designed  with many spaces filled with air is less than
     that of water.
       Finally, by implementing this invention, Archimedes solved the King’s problem.  He has found that
     the crown consisted of false gold. By this  conclusion, then the King furiously  punished the goldsmith.

                        <p>Berikut ini adalah <strong>jawaban</strong> dari pertanyaan dari cerita di atas.</p> <strong>What was the King’s problem suggested to Archimedes? </strong>The king asked Archimedes to determine whether or not the crown was pure gold without harming it in the process. <strong>Did Archimedes immediately answer the King’s question?</strong> No, he didn't immediately answer the King's question. He did several experiments to find the answer.<strong>What was the conclusion of Archimedes after doing many experiments?</strong> The conclusion is that any object 15 which is immersed in a liquid is buoyed up by a force that is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. This is known as Archimedes’ principle. He found the crown wasn't pure gold. The goldsmith has mixed some silver in it. <strong>What is the example according to Archimedes’ principle?</strong> The example according to Archimedes’ principle is if a rock which weighs 100 pounds and has a volume of a cubic foot is submerged in water, splashes out 1 cubic foot of water which weighs 62 pounds. Archimedes explained that the gravitational pull on the rock is 100 pounds downward and the buoyant force is 62 20 pounds upward. Out of water, people would need to exert a force of 100 pounds to lift a rock. In the water people would have to exert a force of 100 pounds minus 62 pounds. It means 38 pounds. The buoyant force of a liquid, or how much it pushes upward, depends on the density of the liquid. <strong>What was the answer of Archimedes to solve the King’s problem? </strong>Archimedes solved the King’s problem. He has found that the crown consisted of false gold. <p></p><p><strong>Pembahasan:</strong></p><p><strong>Recount text </strong>merupakan sebuah rangkaian kalimat yang dijadikan dalam beberapa paragraf yang <strong>menceritakan tentang suatu cerita, peristiwa atau kejadian yang terjadi di masa lampau.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Pelajari Lebih Lanjut:</strong></p><p>Pelajari lebih lanjut mengenai Recount Text pada https://brainly.co.id/tugas/2229266</p><p></p><p><strong>#BelajarBersamaBrainly #SPJ1</strong></p><br />

                            14. D Read the text out loud. How to make batik Materials: 1. White fabric 2. Paint (napthol or indigosol) 3. Design / pattern 4. Pencil 5. Wax 6. Wooden Frame 7. Sodium carbonate 8. Caustic soda 9. Pan and stove (to heat the wax ) Steps: 1. First, prepare the main materials (the design/pattern and the fabric). 2. Wash the fabric to remove any dirt. 3. Draw the pattern. You can draw it with a pencil directly on the fabric or copy it from a paper pattern. 4. Then apply the hot wax along the pattern outline with a canting. Apply the wax to the line or ornaments that you don't want to colour. This step takes time, so you should be patient. 5. When the wax is fully applied, the fabric can be dyed. Immerse the fabric in sodium carbonate in order to enhance absorption of colour. 6. After that, the fabric is immersed in the actual paint (napthol or indigosol) and then rinsed in cold water. 7. The next step is to remove the wax. To do this, we immerse the batik for a few moments in boiling water. Mix caustic soda with the water to help remove the wax. 8. The last step is to dry the batik fabric and the process of making batik is complete. Answer the following questions: 1. What is the text about? 2. What is the first step to make batik? 3. Why do we need a pencil to make batik? 4. Can we use a colourful fabric to make batik? 5. What should we do after drawing the pattern?BANTU JAWAB KAK-!!!​</h2><br />

                            18. Allah SWT created the earth with abundance of minerals. A sample mineral contained only chloride, iodide and nitrate anions. A titration was carried out to determine the chloride and iodide content. Standardized silver nitrate was used as titrant, and a silver wire immersed in the solution was used to monitor the solution’s electrochemical potential as the precipitates formed. The concentration of the standardized silver nitrate solution was 0,1 M. The burette initial reading was 1.35 mL, and the volumes at the two end points were 12.75 ml and 40.95 mL. Given that the original sample was 0.5 g, what is the percentage difference between iodide and chloride in the sample?
(Ksp AgCl = 1,78 x 10-10, AgI = 9,8x10-17), (Molar mass, g.mol-1 for I=126,9, Cl=35,55) (Note: please write the answer IN NUMBER, WITHOUT writing the unit)</h2><br />
