Ex Oblivione
by H. P. Lovecraft
When the last days were upon me, and the ugly trifles of existence began to drive me to madness like the small drops of water that torturers let fall ceaselessly upon one spot of their victims body, I loved the irradiate refuge of sleep. In my dreams I found a little of the beauty I had vainly sought in life, and wandered through old gardens and enchanted woods.
Once when the wind was soft and scented I heard the south calling, and sailed endlessly and languorously under strange stars.
Once when the gentle rain fell I glided in a barge down a sunless stream under the earth till I reached another world of purple twilight, iridescent arbours, and undying roses.
And once I walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and ruins, and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines, and pierced by a little gate of bronze.
Many times I walked through that valley, and longer and longer would I pause in the spectral half-light where the giant trees squirmed and twisted grotesquely, and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to trunk, some times disclosing the mould-stained stones of buried temples. And alway the goal of my fancies was the mighty vine-grown wall with the little gate of bronze therein.
After a while, as the days of waking became less and less bearable from their greyness and sameness, I would often drift in opiate peace through the valley and the shadowy groves, and wonder how I might seize them for my eternal dwelling-place, so that I need no more crawl back to a dull world stript of interest and new colours. And as I looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall, I felt that beyond it lay a dream-country from which, once it was entered, there would be no return.
So each night in sleep I strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in the ivied antique wall, though it was exceedingly well hidden. And I would tell myself that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting merely, but more lovely and radiant as well.
Then one night in the dream-city of Zakarion I found a yellowed papyrus filled with the thoughts of dream-sages who dwelt of old in that city, and who were too wise ever to be born in the waking world. Therein were written many things concerning the world of dream, and among them was lore of a golden valley and a sacred grove with temples, and a high wall pierced by a little bronze gate. When I saw this lore, I knew that it touched on the scenes I had haunted, and I therefore read long in the yellowed papyrus.
Some of the dream-sages wrote gorgeously of the wonders beyond the irrepassable gate, but others told of horror and disappointment. I knew not which to believe, yet longed more and more to cross for ever into the unknown land; for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures, and no new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace. So when I learned of the drug which would unlock the gate and drive me through, I resolved to take it when next I awaked.
Last night I swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden valley and the shadowy groves; and when I came this time to the antique wall, I saw that the small gate of bronze was ajar. From beyond came a glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the buried temples, and I drifted on songfully, expectant of the glories of the land from whence I should never return.
But as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of the drug and the dream pushed me through, I knew that all sights and glories were at an end; for in that new realm was neither land nor sea, but only the white void of unpeopled and illimitable space. So, happier than I had ever dared hope to be, I dissolved again into that native infinity of crystal oblivion from which the daemon Life had called me for one brief and desolate hour.</a>

                                            There appears to be increasing numbers of children who specialize in a single sport an early age. The lure of a college scholarship or a professional career can motivate young athletes to commit to specialized training regimens at an early age. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding specializing in one sport before puberty.    Once puberty begins, both boys and girls go through their adolescent growth spurt (AGS). The change and the age at which they occur can have an impact on a child's sport performance. Going through this can have a significant impact on athletic performance in both positive and negative ways. Increases in body size, hormones, and muscle strength can improve athletics performance. Nevertheless, there may be a temporary decline in balance skills and body control during the AGS. Quick increases in height and weight affect the body's center of gravity. Sometimes, the brain needs to adjust to this higher observation point. As a result, a teen may seem a little clumsy.    This phase is especially noticeable in sports that require good balance and body control (e.g. figure skating, diving, gymnastics, and basketball). In addition, longer arms and legs can affect throwing any type of ball, hitting with a bat, catching with a glove, or swimming and jumping. Coaches that are aware of the AGS can help reduce athletic awkwardness by incorporating specific aspects of training into practice sessions.Which sentence is closest in meaning to the past sentence in paragraph 3?A. by designing training founded on the knowledge of AGS, trainers can be more aware of possible difficulties in sports.B. with practice that prevents children from performing awkwardly, trainers can assist children through this growth phaseC. to help children perform with more ease, trainers should consider the effects of puberty when designing a training routine.D. without considering the physical changes undergone by children, trainers cannot prevent them from having difficulties when training.E. since identifying potential problems during children's phase of AGS is necessary to eliminate clumsiness, trainer can do this before training begins.​</a>

Lake Toba is actually more like a sea than a lake considering its size. Therefore, this lake is the second largest lake in the world after Lake Victoria in Africa. Lake Toba is also the deepest lake in the world, which is approximately 450 meters. There is an island in the middle of Lake Toba. That is Samoirisland. Its altitude is 1,000 meters above sea level. Although it has been a tourist destination for a long time, the island of Samosir is a virgin natural site. In the middle of the island of Samosir, there are two more beautiful lakes named Lake Aek Sidhoni and Lake Natonang. The area around 1oba has pine forests that are beautifully arranged with green nuances. On the outskirts of Lake Loba there are several waterfalls that are very enchanting. In addition, visitors can find suifur springs. On the island of Samosir, tourists can also find misty mountains, clear waters for swimming, and agricultural communities.

                                            buatlah kesimpulan dari berita ini
The weakening of the rupiah against the US dollar has left major retailers in the country with no choice but to increase the price of their products to offset ballooning production costs. 
Some companies, however, are trying to maintain current prices in light of the diminishing purchasing power experienced by customers.
Publicly listed consumer-goods producer PT Unilever Indonesia, for instance, increased its prices by an average of 1 percent in August, which was the second price hike decision made by the company this year after the previous 1 percent increase imposed in March.
Last year, the local arm of Anglo-Dutch consumer-goods manufacturer Unilever NV and plc adjusted its prices twice, comprising a 4 to 5 percent hike in March and another 5 percent rise in September.
Unilever Indonesia governance and corporate affairs director Sancoyo Antarikso said recently the price increases occurred following the plummeting rupiah.
“Around 50 to 55 percent of the products’ components are related to the currency volatility,” he said, giving the price of crude palm oil (CPO) as an example.
“We buy those [CPO] using rupiah but the market price is determined in US dollars,” he said, adding that the situation affected his firm’s production costs.
The value of the rupiah against the greenback continued its slide last week with a new record marked last Wednesday when the currency broke the psychological barrier of 14,000, closing at 14,133, a level unseen since the 1998 financial crisis. 
The rupiah has weakened by more than 12 percent since the beginning of this year. However, the rupiah experienced a slight recovery on Friday when it closed at 13,983.
Meanwhile, Triyono Prijosoesilo, chairman of the Association of Indonesian Soft Drink Producers (Asrim), said its association members were still trying to keep prices at current levels because of the decline in consumer purchasing power.
“Our products are tertiary goods, so if their prices rise, our products will be the first to be left [by consumers],” he said over the weekend.
Refined sugar, aluminum and certain types of plastic packages were among the imported materials, he said.
In addition, retailer Transmart Carrefour corporate communications general manager Satria Hamid said recently that reduced purchasing power had caused customers to be selective in buying goods.
“They only buy things they really need,” he said, adding that price hike decisions made by retailers depended in turn on prices set by suppliers or producers.
Meanwhile, several retailers have been working with credit card issuers and suppliers to offer various promotions to lure customers, he said.
Azza Waslati, a mother of three living in Cibubur, West Java, has noticed the rise in prices since July.
“I have started to look for promotions offered by supermarkets as my weekly budget is now only enough to last three to four days,” she said on Sunday, noting that some supermarkets she frequented had increased the prices of certain products while maintaining the stability of other prices.
Azza further indicated she now preferred to buy eggs instead of poultry as the price of poultry has jumped to Rp 40,000 (US$2.84) per kilogram from around Rp 35,000.
“Maybe this is the time to start eating more greens,” she said while laughing, adding that vegetables had had the smallest price hikes.</a>

Transportation authorities are mulling over charging private cars entering Jakarta as part of an attempt to ease traffic gridlock.
“It’s part of our short- and long-term plans […] In our long-term plan, we want to set fares for every car entering Jakarta,” Greater Jakarta Transportation Body (BPTJ) head Bambang Prihartono said on Sunday as quoted by kompas.com.
To support the policy, he said the body would prepare more buses to carry commuters, adding that by the end of this year, an additional 1,000 buses were expected to begin operation. 
The body has previously implemented an odd-even policy at the West and East Bekasi toll gates in West Java as part of their major attempt to limit the number of private cars entering Jakarta from the outskirts. As a consequence, a dedicated lane for buses has been prepared to lure more people to use the public transportation service. 
A potential policy to support the restriction, Bambang said, was to apply an electronic road pricing (ERP) program. “Otherwise, public transportation services provided by the government won’t be able to compete with private cars,” he said. 
Bambang said the implementation of the policy would require more time, as he needed to further study its framework, including discussing it with relevant agencies and city administrations.
He added that to encourage more use of public transportation, more transit-oriented development areas were needed where housing areas are directly interconnected with public transportation. (fac)</a>

One day, the children's stepmother persuaded their father to take the children and abandon them in the forest. The first time, Hansel left a trail of pebbles along the way and found the way back. Next time, the father took them deeper into the forest, and Hansel left breadcrumbs to find their way back. But when the children tried to find their way back home they found that the birds had eaten the crumbs. So the children were lost in the woods.They wandered in the forest and soon discovered a house made entirely of gingerbread and sweets. Hungry and tired, the children began to eat the rooftop of the house when the door opens. An old woman – the owner of the house – kindly invited them inside. Not knowing that this old woman was a witch who built a gingerbread house to lure children into her trap. She imprisoned Hansel and made Gretel her slave. The old witch planned to eat both children.W</a>

Ex Oblivione
by H. P. Lovecraft
When the last days were upon me, and the ugly trifles of existence began to drive me to madness like the small drops of water that torturers let fall ceaselessly upon one spot of their victims body, I loved the irradiate refuge of sleep. In my dreams I found a little of the beauty I had vainly sought in life, and wandered through old gardens and enchanted woods.
Once when the wind was soft and scented I heard the south calling, and sailed endlessly and languorously under strange stars.
Once when the gentle rain fell I glided in a barge down a sunless stream under the earth till I reached another world of purple twilight, iridescent arbours, and undying roses.
And once I walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and ruins, and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines, and pierced by a little gate of bronze.
Many times I walked through that valley, and longer and longer would I pause in the spectral half-light where the giant trees squirmed and twisted grotesquely, and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to trunk, some times disclosing the mould-stained stones of buried temples. And alway the goal of my fancies was the mighty vine-grown wall with the little gate of bronze therein.
After a while, as the days of waking became less and less bearable from their greyness and sameness, I would often drift in opiate peace through the valley and the shadowy groves, and wonder how I might seize them for my eternal dwelling-place, so that I need no more crawl back to a dull world stript of interest and new colours. And as I looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall, I felt that beyond it lay a dream-country from which, once it was entered, there would be no return.
So each night in sleep I strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in the ivied antique wall, though it was exceedingly well hidden. And I would tell myself that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting merely, but more lovely and radiant as well.
Then one night in the dream-city of Zakarion I found a yellowed papyrus filled with the thoughts of dream-sages who dwelt of old in that city, and who were too wise ever to be born in the waking world. Therein were written many things concerning the world of dream, and among them was lore of a golden valley and a sacred grove with temples, and a high wall pierced by a little bronze gate. When I saw this lore, I knew that it touched on the scenes I had haunted, and I therefore read long in the yellowed papyrus.
Some of the dream-sages wrote gorgeously of the wonders beyond the irrepassable gate, but others told of horror and disappointment. I knew not which to believe, yet longed more and more to cross for ever into the unknown land; for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures, and no new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace. So when I learned of the drug which would unlock the gate and drive me through, I resolved to take it when next I awaked.
Last night I swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden valley and the shadowy groves; and when I came this time to the antique wall, I saw that the small gate of bronze was ajar. From beyond came a glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the buried temples, and I drifted on songfully, expectant of the glories of the land from whence I should never return.
But as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of the drug and the dream pushed me through, I knew that all sights and glories were at an end; for in that new realm was neither land nor sea, but only the white void of unpeopled and illimitable space. So, happier than I had ever dared hope to be, I dissolved again into that native infinity of crystal oblivion from which the daemon Life had called me for one brief and desolate hour.</h2><br />

                            8. There appears to be increasing numbers of children who specialize in a single sport an early age. The lure of a college scholarship or a professional career can motivate young athletes to commit to specialized training regimens at an early age. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding specializing in one sport before puberty.    Once puberty begins, both boys and girls go through their adolescent growth spurt (AGS). The change and the age at which they occur can have an impact on a child's sport performance. Going through this can have a significant impact on athletic performance in both positive and negative ways. Increases in body size, hormones, and muscle strength can improve athletics performance. Nevertheless, there may be a temporary decline in balance skills and body control during the AGS. Quick increases in height and weight affect the body's center of gravity. Sometimes, the brain needs to adjust to this higher observation point. As a result, a teen may seem a little clumsy.    This phase is especially noticeable in sports that require good balance and body control (e.g. figure skating, diving, gymnastics, and basketball). In addition, longer arms and legs can affect throwing any type of ball, hitting with a bat, catching with a glove, or swimming and jumping. Coaches that are aware of the AGS can help reduce athletic awkwardness by incorporating specific aspects of training into practice sessions.Which sentence is closest in meaning to the past sentence in paragraph 3?A. by designing training founded on the knowledge of AGS, trainers can be more aware of possible difficulties in sports.B. with practice that prevents children from performing awkwardly, trainers can assist children through this growth phaseC. to help children perform with more ease, trainers should consider the effects of puberty when designing a training routine.D. without considering the physical changes undergone by children, trainers cannot prevent them from having difficulties when training.E. since identifying potential problems during children's phase of AGS is necessary to eliminate clumsiness, trainer can do this before training begins.​</h2><br />

The area around 1oba has pine forests that are beautifully arranged with green nuances. On the outskirts of Lake Loba there are several waterfalls that are very enchanting.

                            14. buatlah kesimpulan dari berita ini
The weakening of the rupiah against the US dollar has left major retailers in the country with no choice but to increase the price of their products to offset ballooning production costs. 
Some companies, however, are trying to maintain current prices in light of the diminishing purchasing power experienced by customers.
Publicly listed consumer-goods producer PT Unilever Indonesia, for instance, increased its prices by an average of 1 percent in August, which was the second price hike decision made by the company this year after the previous 1 percent increase imposed in March.
Last year, the local arm of Anglo-Dutch consumer-goods manufacturer Unilever NV and plc adjusted its prices twice, comprising a 4 to 5 percent hike in March and another 5 percent rise in September.
Unilever Indonesia governance and corporate affairs director Sancoyo Antarikso said recently the price increases occurred following the plummeting rupiah.
“Around 50 to 55 percent of the products’ components are related to the currency volatility,” he said, giving the price of crude palm oil (CPO) as an example.
“We buy those [CPO] using rupiah but the market price is determined in US dollars,” he said, adding that the situation affected his firm’s production costs.
The value of the rupiah against the greenback continued its slide last week with a new record marked last Wednesday when the currency broke the psychological barrier of 14,000, closing at 14,133, a level unseen since the 1998 financial crisis. 
The rupiah has weakened by more than 12 percent since the beginning of this year. However, the rupiah experienced a slight recovery on Friday when it closed at 13,983.
Meanwhile, Triyono Prijosoesilo, chairman of the Association of Indonesian Soft Drink Producers (Asrim), said its association members were still trying to keep prices at current levels because of the decline in consumer purchasing power.
“Our products are tertiary goods, so if their prices rise, our products will be the first to be left [by consumers],” he said over the weekend.
Refined sugar, aluminum and certain types of plastic packages were among the imported materials, he said.
In addition, retailer Transmart Carrefour corporate communications general manager Satria Hamid said recently that reduced purchasing power had caused customers to be selective in buying goods.
“They only buy things they really need,” he said, adding that price hike decisions made by retailers depended in turn on prices set by suppliers or producers.
Meanwhile, several retailers have been working with credit card issuers and suppliers to offer various promotions to lure customers, he said.
Azza Waslati, a mother of three living in Cibubur, West Java, has noticed the rise in prices since July.
“I have started to look for promotions offered by supermarkets as my weekly budget is now only enough to last three to four days,” she said on Sunday, noting that some supermarkets she frequented had increased the prices of certain products while maintaining the stability of other prices.
Azza further indicated she now preferred to buy eggs instead of poultry as the price of poultry has jumped to Rp 40,000 (US$2.84) per kilogram from around Rp 35,000.
“Maybe this is the time to start eating more greens,” she said while laughing, adding that vegetables had had the smallest price hikes.</h2><br />

“ Since I graduated from senior high school, I have never celebrated Valentine’s Day. I used to have dinner with my schoolmates but that was more because we want to get together for dinner. I think Valentine’s Day is not part of Indonesian culture. It may be a special day for foreigner but I will be staying home because I will have to work on the following day.” 
Ahmad Pauji, 25, works in a company on Jalan Rasuna Said, Central Jakarta. He lives in Cileduk, Tangerang. 
“Valentine’s is a good moment for a trader to gain more profits. It is a chance for them to promote their products. My girlfriend sells women’s attire in Bandung and gives a 20 percent discount on all pink items. The target is teenage girls. Many restaurants also do their best to lure more people for dinner. I never celebrate it as special day. I never say “Happy Valentine’s to my girlfriend even though she often gives me a special gifts. Last year, for example, she sent me a photo album and romantic poems but I only said thanks in return.

Transportation authorities are mulling over charging private cars entering Jakarta as part of an attempt to ease traffic gridlock.
“It’s part of our short- and long-term plans […] In our long-term plan, we want to set fares for every car entering Jakarta,” Greater Jakarta Transportation Body (BPTJ) head Bambang Prihartono said on Sunday as quoted by kompas.com.
To support the policy, he said the body would prepare more buses to carry commuters, adding that by the end of this year, an additional 1,000 buses were expected to begin operation. 
The body has previously implemented an odd-even policy at the West and East Bekasi toll gates in West Java as part of their major attempt to limit the number of private cars entering Jakarta from the outskirts. As a consequence, a dedicated lane for buses has been prepared to lure more people to use the public transportation service. 
A potential policy to support the restriction, Bambang said, was to apply an electronic road pricing (ERP) program. “Otherwise, public transportation services provided by the government won’t be able to compete with private cars,” he said. 
Bambang said the implementation of the policy would require more time, as he needed to further study its framework, including discussing it with relevant agencies and city administrations.
He added that to encourage more use of public transportation, more transit-oriented development areas were needed where housing areas are directly interconnected with public transportation. (fac)</h2><br />

One day, the children's stepmother persuaded their father to take the children and abandon them in the forest. The first time, Hansel left a trail of pebbles along the way and found the way back. Next time, the father took them deeper into the forest, and Hansel left breadcrumbs to find their way back. But when the children tried to find their way back home they found that the birds had eaten the crumbs. So the children were lost in the woods.They wandered in the forest and soon discovered a house made entirely of gingerbread and sweets. Hungry and tired, the children began to eat the rooftop of the house when the door opens. An old woman – the owner of the house – kindly invited them inside. Not knowing that this old woman was a witch who built a gingerbread house to lure children into her trap. She imprisoned Hansel and made Gretel her slave. The old witch planned to eat both children.W</h2><br />
